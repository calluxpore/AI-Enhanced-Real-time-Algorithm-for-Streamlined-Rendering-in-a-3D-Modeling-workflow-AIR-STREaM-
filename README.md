## AI-Enhanced Real-time Algorithm for Streamlined Rendering in a 3D Modeling Workflow (AIR STREaM)

### Overview
"AI-Enhanced Real-time Algorithm for Streamlined Rendering in a 3D Modeling Workflow (AIR STREaM)" is a groundbreaking project by Samarth Reddy at OCAD University, exploring the integration of artificial intelligence in digital design and 3D modeling. This project delves into various AI platforms, models, and APIs across text, image, and audio domains to enhance 3D modeling and rendering processes, making them more efficient and creative.

### Objectives
- Explore AI platforms for digital design.
- Investigate AI models/UIs for design tasks.
- Demonstrate AI integration in design workflows.
- Conduct experiments showcasing AI applications in design.


### Research Approach
Adopting a "Research through Design" method, the project explores AI tools across various domains, leading to the creation of custom AI applications and a near real-time rendering engine.

### Key Experiments
- Creating custom GPT models.
- Training custom image models with Stable Diffusion.
- AI-enhanced visualization in 3D modeling.

### Tools and Technologies
The project uses hardware like Nvidia RTX 3080 and software including Rhinoceros 7 and Grasshopper, along with various AI platforms.

LoRA Parameters:
- Runs with SDXL

- Positive Prompt: ink circle, flawless and stark, centered on a pristine canvas, surrounded by a chaotic dance of black and white splatters. This imagery evokes a striking contrast between order and disorder, the circle's perfect form clashing with the wild, unpredictable splashes around it. The monochromatic palette enhances the dramatic interplay of shapes and textures, inviting a deeper reflection on the balance between harmony and turmoil. This composition, with its bold simplicity and complex emotions, captures a moment frozen in time, where every splatter tells a story of spontaneous movement, creating a compelling, visually arresting piece that resonates with the viewer's inner thoughts and feelings. <lora:arlo:1>
